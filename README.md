### RPG game in python (as exercise) from https://www.udemy.com/python-complete/
### The Complete Python 3 Course: Beginner to Advanced!
### Instructors: Joseph Delgadillo / Nick Germain

Some solutions are different from those presented in the course

Even the game is not fully operational (it  is not included the enemy choose items - for instance, and some refactoring is needed also...) I think this was a pretty good exercise.
